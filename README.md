#This is an English Chatbot project held in Korea University.

##Dialogflow is used to make a chatbot.

This is for Korean elementry students who are learning English as a second language.
There are 3 types of scripts of chatbot. Chatbot1 is the easiest, for 3rd grade
and 4th grade. Chatbot2 is for 4th to 5th grade students, and Chatbot3 is the
hardest chatbot in here. 

For now, I got help from Dialogflow web demo and dialogflow messenger.
I will make my independent chatbot later on.

This chatbot can listen to English, see English words.

This chatbot shows answers in picture or words.
